# T.U.R.A. Coding Book

This book is designed to introduce you to the world of computer science by explaining key concepts in a clear and accessible way. In addition to concept explanations, it includes hints and full solutions to problems from the CSES Problem Set. For many of these problems, we could not find consistently clear explanations in existing resources, which motivated us to write our own. We hope this book supports and inspires you throughout your programming journey :)
